# My Python Project

This project is designed to process various file formats and manage configurations through an extensible plugin system. It allows for easy integration of new functionalities, such as support for additional file formats or cloud services.

## Project Structure

```

├── src
│   ├── main.py            # Main entry point for the application
│   ├── plugins            # Directory for plugin implementations
│   │   ├── __init__.py    # Initialization file for the plugins package
│   │   └── base_plugin.py  # Base class for plugins
│   └── utils              # Utility functions
│       └── config.py      # Configuration management
├── requirements.txt       # Project dependencies
└── README.md              # Project documentation
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-python-project
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the application, execute the following command:
```
python src/main.py
```

## Adding Plugins

To add a new plugin, create a new Python file in the `src/plugins` directory that inherits from the `Plugin` base class defined in `base_plugin.py`. Implement the `process_file` method to define the plugin's functionality.
